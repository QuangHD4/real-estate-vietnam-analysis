## 📋 Ground Rules

- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions.
- Follow the [branch protection rules](https://github.com/QuangHD4/real-estate-vietnam-analysis/settings/branches) — no direct pushes to `main`.
- All changes must go through a pull request and be reviewed.
- If your pull request touches files listed in the `CODEOWNERS` file, approval from the designated owner is required.
